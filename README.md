This a semester project for my database course at the university. 

This project created to explain basic functions of SQL and it is about the street penalty system in Germany.

How it works:
The information of the street penalty has been saved in the database and SQL procedure has been created to request the information and calculate the amount of penalty and 'Punkte in Flensburg' with a given speed, time and street information.

Feel free to use it or suggest any improvement for the project. Any help and suggestion is greatly appreciated.
